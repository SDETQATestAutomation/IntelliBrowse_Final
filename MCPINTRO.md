# Introduction
> Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of
MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to
connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way
to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
## Why MCP?
MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to
integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
* A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
* The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
* Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
### General architecture
At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to
multiple servers:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph "Your Computer"
Host["Host with MCP Client\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
S1["MCP Server A"]
S2["MCP Server B"]
S3["MCP Server C"]
Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3
S1 <--> D1[("Local\nData Source A")]
S2 <--> D2[("Local\nData Source B")]
end
subgraph "Internet"
S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| D3[("Remote\nService C")]
end
```
* **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data
through MCP
* **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
* **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
* **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
* **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

# Building MCP with LLMs
> Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!
This guide will help you use LLMs to help you build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. We'll be focusing on Claude for this tutorial, but you can do this with any frontier LLM.
## Preparing the documentation
Before starting, gather the necessary documentation to help Claude understand MCP:
1. Visit [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt) and copy the full documentation text
2. Navigate to either the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
3. Copy the README files and other relevant documentation
4. Paste these documents into your conversation with Claude
## Describing your server
Once you've provided the documentation, clearly describe to Claude what kind of server you want to build. Be specific about:
* What resources your server will expose
* What tools it will provide
* Any prompts it should offer
* What external systems it needs to interact with
For example:
```
Build an MCP server that:
- Connects to my company's PostgreSQL database
- Exposes table schemas as resources
- Provides tools for running read-only SQL queries
- Includes prompts for common data analysis tasks
```
## Working with Claude
When working with Claude on MCP servers:
1. Start with the core functionality first, then iterate to add more features
2. Ask Claude to explain any parts of the code you don't understand
3. Request modifications or improvements as needed
4. Have Claude help you test the server and handle edge cases
Claude can help implement all the key MCP features:
* Resource management and exposure
* Tool definitions and implementations
* Prompt templates and handlers
* Error handling and logging
* Connection and transport setup
## Best practices
When building MCP servers with Claude:
* Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
* Test each component thoroughly before moving on
* Keep security in mind - validate inputs and limit access appropriately
* Document your code well for future maintenance
* Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully
## Next steps
After Claude helps you build your server:
1. Review the generated code carefully
2. Test the server with the MCP Inspector tool
3. Connect it to Claude.app or other MCP clients
4. Iterate based on real usage and feedback
Remember that Claude can help you modify and improve your server as requirements change over time.
Need more guidance? Just ask Claude specific questions about implementing MCP features or troubleshooting issues that arise.
# Core architecture
> Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.
## Overview
MCP follows a client-server architecture where:
* **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
* **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
* **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients
```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph "Host"
client1[MCP Client]
client2[MCP Client]
end
subgraph "Server Process"
server1[MCP Server]
end
subgraph "Server Process"
server2[MCP Server]
end
client1 <-->|Transport Layer| server1
client2 <-->|Transport Layer| server2
```
## Core components
### Protocol layer
The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> {
// Handle incoming requests
setRequestHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (request: T, extra: RequestHandlerExtra) => Promise<Result>): void
// Handle incoming notifications
setNotificationHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (notification: T) => Promise<void>): void
// Send requests and await responses
request<T>(request: Request, schema: T, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>
// Send one-way notifications
notification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
class Session(BaseSession[RequestT, NotificationT, ResultT]):
async def send_request(
self,
request: RequestT,
result_type: type[Result]
) -> Result:
"""Send request and wait for response. Raises McpError if response contains error."""
# Request handling implementation
async def send_notification(
self,
notification: NotificationT
) -> None:
"""Send one-way notification that doesn't expect response."""
# Notification handling implementation
async def _received_request(
self,
responder: RequestResponder[ReceiveRequestT, ResultT]
) -> None:
"""Handle incoming request from other side."""
# Request handling implementation
async def _received_notification(
self,
notification: ReceiveNotificationT
) -> None:
"""Handle incoming notification from other side."""
# Notification handling implementation
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
Key classes include:
* `Protocol`
* `Client`
* `Server`
### Transport layer
The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:
1. **Stdio transport**
* Uses standard input/output for communication
* Ideal for local processes
2. **HTTP with SSE transport**
* Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
* HTTP POST for client-to-server messages
All transports use [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 to exchange messages. See the [specification](/specification/) for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.
### Message types
MCP has these main types of messages:
1. **Requests** expect a response from the other side:
```typescript
interface Request {
method: string;
params?: { ... };
}
```
2. **Results** are successful responses to requests:
```typescript
interface Result {
[key: string]: unknown;
}
```
3. **Errors** indicate that a request failed:
```typescript
interface Error {
code: number;
message: string;
data?: unknown;
}
```
4. **Notifications** are one-way messages that don't expect a response:
```typescript
interface Notification {
method: string;
params?: { ... };
}
```
## Connection lifecycle
### 1. Initialization
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Client
participant Server
Client->>Server: initialize request
Server->>Client: initialize response
Client->>Server: initialized notification
Note over Client,Server: Connection ready for use
```
1. Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities
2. Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
3. Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment
4. Normal message exchange begins
### 2. Message exchange
After initialization, the following patterns are supported:
* **Request-Response**: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
* **Notifications**: Either party sends one-way messages
### 3. Termination
Either party can terminate the connection:
* Clean shutdown via `close()`
* Transport disconnection
* Error conditions
## Error handling
MCP defines these standard error codes:
```typescript
enum ErrorCode {
// Standard JSON-RPC error codes
ParseError = -32700,
InvalidRequest = -32600,
MethodNotFound = -32601,
InvalidParams = -32602,
InternalError = -32603,
}
```
SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.
Errors are propagated through:
* Error responses to requests
* Error events on transports
* Protocol-level error handlers
## Implementation example
Here's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
const server = new Server({
name: "example-server",
version: "1.0.0"
}, {
capabilities: {
resources: {}
}
});
// Handle requests
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
return {
resources: [
{
uri: "example://resource",
name: "Example Resource"
}
]
};
});
// Connect transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
import asyncio
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server
app = Server("example-server")
@app.list_resources()
async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
return [
types.Resource(
uri="example://resource",
name="Example Resource"
)
]
async def main():
async with stdio_server() as streams:
await app.run(
streams[0],
streams[1],
app.create_initialization_options()
)
if __name__ == "__main__":
asyncio.run(main())
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
## Best practices
### Transport selection
1. **Local communication**
* Use stdio transport for local processes
* Efficient for same-machine communication
* Simple process management
2. **Remote communication**
* Use SSE for scenarios requiring HTTP compatibility
* Consider security implications including authentication and authorization
### Message handling
1. **Request processing**
* Validate inputs thoroughly
* Use type-safe schemas
* Handle errors gracefully
* Implement timeouts
2. **Progress reporting**
* Use progress tokens for long operations
* Report progress incrementally
* Include total progress when known
3. **Error management**
* Use appropriate error codes
* Include helpful error messages
* Clean up resources on errors
## Security considerations
1. **Transport security**
* Use TLS for remote connections
* Validate connection origins
* Implement authentication when needed
2. **Message validation**
* Validate all incoming messages
* Sanitize inputs
* Check message size limits
* Verify JSON-RPC format
3. **Resource protection**
* Implement access controls
* Validate resource paths
* Monitor resource usage
* Rate limit requests
4. **Error handling**
* Don't leak sensitive information
* Log security-relevant errors
* Implement proper cleanup
* Handle DoS scenarios
## Debugging and monitoring
1. **Logging**
* Log protocol events
* Track message flow
* Monitor performance
* Record errors
2. **Diagnostics**
* Implement health checks
* Monitor connection state
* Track resource usage
* Profile performance
3. **Testing**
* Test different transports
* Verify error handling
* Check edge cases
* Load test servers
# Resources
> Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs
Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.
<Note>
Resources are designed to be **application-controlled**, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used.
Different MCP clients may handle resources differently. For example:
* Claude Desktop currently requires users to explicitly select resources before they can be used
* Other clients might automatically select resources based on heuristics
* Some implementations may even allow the AI model itself to determine which resources to use
Server authors should be prepared to handle any of these interaction patterns when implementing resource support. In order to expose data to models automatically, server authors should use a **model-controlled** primitive such as [Tools](./tools).
</Note>
## Overview
Resources represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:
* File contents
* Database records
* API responses
* Live system data
* Screenshots and images
* Log files
* And more
Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.
## Resource URIs
Resources are identified using URIs that follow this format:
```
[protocol]://[host]/[path]
```
For example:
* `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`
* `postgres://database/customers/schema`
* `screen://localhost/display1`
The protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.
## Resource types
Resources can contain two types of content:
### Text resources
Text resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for:
* Source code
* Configuration files
* Log files
* JSON/XML data
* Plain text
### Binary resources
Binary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for:
* Images
* PDFs
* Audio files
* Video files
* Other non-text formats
## Resource discovery
Clients can discover available resources through two main methods:
### Direct resources
Servers expose a list of concrete resources via the `resources/list` endpoint. Each resource includes:
```typescript
{
uri: string; // Unique identifier for the resource
name: string; // Human-readable name
description?: string; // Optional description
mimeType?: string; // Optional MIME type
size?: number; // Optional size in bytes
}
```
### Resource templates
For dynamic resources, servers can expose [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) that clients can use to construct valid resource URIs:
```typescript
{
uriTemplate: string; // URI template following RFC 6570
name: string; // Human-readable name for this type
description?: string; // Optional description
mimeType?: string; // Optional MIME type for all matching resources
}
```
## Reading resources
To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the resource URI.
The server responds with a list of resource contents:
```typescript
{
contents: [
{
uri: string; // The URI of the resource
mimeType?: string; // Optional MIME type
// One of:
text?: string; // For text resources
blob?: string; // For binary resources (base64 encoded)
}
]
}
```
<Tip>
Servers may return multiple resources in response to one `resources/read` request. This could be used, for example, to return a list of files inside a directory when the directory is read.
</Tip>
## Resource updates
MCP supports real-time updates for resources through two mechanisms:
### List changes
Servers can notify clients when their list of available resources changes via the `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification.
### Content changes
Clients can subscribe to updates for specific resources:
1. Client sends `resources/subscribe` with resource URI
2. Server sends `notifications/resources/updated` when the resource changes
3. Client can fetch latest content with `resources/read`
4. Client can unsubscribe with `resources/unsubscribe`
## Example implementation
Here's a simple example of implementing resource support in an MCP server:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
const server = new Server({
name: "example-server",
version: "1.0.0"
}, {
capabilities: {
resources: {}
}
});
// List available resources
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
return {
resources: [
{
uri: "file:///logs/app.log",
name: "Application Logs",
mimeType: "text/plain"
}
]
};
});
// Read resource contents
server.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {
const uri = request.params.uri;
if (uri === "file:///logs/app.log") {
const logContents = await readLogFile();
return {
contents: [
{
uri,
mimeType: "text/plain",
text: logContents
}
]
};
}
throw new Error("Resource not found");
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
app = Server("example-server")
@app.list_resources()
async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
return [
types.Resource(
uri="file:///logs/app.log",
name="Application Logs",
mimeType="text/plain"
)
]
@app.read_resource()
async def read_resource(uri: AnyUrl) -> str:
if str(uri) == "file:///logs/app.log":
log_contents = await read_log_file()
return log_contents
raise ValueError("Resource not found")
# Start server
async with stdio_server() as streams:
await app.run(
streams[0],
streams[1],
app.create_initialization_options()
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
## Best practices
When implementing resource support:
1. Use clear, descriptive resource names and URIs
2. Include helpful descriptions to guide LLM understanding
3. Set appropriate MIME types when known
4. Implement resource templates for dynamic content
5. Use subscriptions for frequently changing resources
6. Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages
7. Consider pagination for large resource lists
8. Cache resource contents when appropriate
9. Validate URIs before processing
10. Document your custom URI schemes
## Security considerations
When exposing resources:
* Validate all resource URIs
* Implement appropriate access controls
* Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
* Be cautious with binary data handling
* Consider rate limiting for resource reads
* Audit resource access
* Encrypt sensitive data in transit
* Validate MIME types
* Implement timeouts for long-running reads
* Handle resource cleanup appropriately
# Prompts
> Create reusable prompt templates and workflows
Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.
<Note>
Prompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.
</Note>
## Overview
Prompts in MCP are predefined templates that can:
* Accept dynamic arguments
* Include context from resources
* Chain multiple interactions
* Guide specific workflows
* Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)
## Prompt structure
Each prompt is defined with:
```typescript
{
name: string; // Unique identifier for the prompt
description?: string; // Human-readable description
arguments?: [ // Optional list of arguments
{
name: string; // Argument identifier
description?: string; // Argument description
required?: boolean; // Whether argument is required
}
]
}
```
## Discovering prompts
Clients can discover available prompts through the `prompts/list` endpoint:
```typescript
// Request
{
method: "prompts/list";
}
// Response
{
prompts: [
{
name: "analyze-code",
description: "Analyze code for potential improvements",
arguments: [
{
name: "language",
description: "Programming language",
required: true,
},
],
},
];
}
```
## Using prompts
To use a prompt, clients make a `prompts/get` request:
````typescript
// Request
{
method: "prompts/get",
params: {
name: "analyze-code",
arguments: {
language: "python"
}
}
}
// Response
{
description: "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
messages: [
{
role: "user",
content: {
type: "text",
text: "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(numbers):\n total = 0\n for num in numbers:\n total = total + num\n return total\n\nresult = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(result)\n```"
}
}
]
}
````
## Dynamic prompts
Prompts can be dynamic and include:
### Embedded resource context
```json
{
"name": "analyze-project",
"description": "Analyze project logs and code",
"arguments": [
{
"name": "timeframe",
"description": "Time period to analyze logs",
"required": true
},
{
"name": "fileUri",
"description": "URI of code file to review",
"required": true
}
]
}
```
When handling the `prompts/get` request:
```json
{
"messages": [
{
"role": "user",
"content": {
"type": "text",
"text": "Analyze these system logs and the code file for any issues:"
}
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": {
"type": "resource",
"resource": {
"uri": "logs://recent?timeframe=1h",
"text": "[2024-03-14 15:32:11] ERROR: Connection timeout in network.py:127\n[2024-03-14 15:32:15] WARN: Retrying connection (attempt 2/3)\n[2024-03-14 15:32:20] ERROR: Max retries exceeded",
"mimeType": "text/plain"
}
}
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": {
"type": "resource",
"resource": {
"uri": "file:///path/to/code.py",
"text": "def connect_to_service(timeout=30):\n retries = 3\n for attempt in range(retries):\n try:\n return establish_connection(timeout)\n except TimeoutError:\n if attempt == retries - 1:\n raise\n time.sleep(5)\n\ndef establish_connection(timeout):\n # Connection implementation\n pass",
"mimeType": "text/x-python"
}
}
}
]
}
```
### Multi-step workflows
```typescript
const debugWorkflow = {
name: "debug-error",
async getMessages(error: string) {
return [
{
role: "user",
content: {
type: "text",
text: `Here's an error I'm seeing: ${error}`,
},
},
{
role: "assistant",
content: {
type: "text",
text: "I'll help analyze this error. What have you tried so far?",
},
},
{
role: "user",
content: {
type: "text",
text: "I've tried restarting the service, but the error persists.",
},
},
];
},
};
```

## Best practices
When implementing prompts:
1. Use clear, descriptive prompt names
2. Provide detailed descriptions for prompts and arguments
3. Validate all required arguments
4. Handle missing arguments gracefully
5. Consider versioning for prompt templates
6. Cache dynamic content when appropriate
7. Implement error handling
8. Document expected argument formats
9. Consider prompt composability
10. Test prompts with various inputs
## UI integration
Prompts can be surfaced in client UIs as:
* Slash commands
* Quick actions
* Context menu items
* Command palette entries
* Guided workflows
* Interactive forms
## Updates and changes
Servers can notify clients about prompt changes:
1. Server capability: `prompts.listChanged`
2. Notification: `notifications/prompts/list_changed`
3. Client re-fetches prompt list
## Security considerations
When implementing prompts:
* Validate all arguments
* Sanitize user input
* Consider rate limiting
* Implement access controls
* Audit prompt usage
* Handle sensitive data appropriately
* Validate generated content
* Implement timeouts
* Consider prompt injection risks
* Document security requirements
# Tools
> Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server
Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.
<Note>
Tools are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).
</Note>
## Overview
Tools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:
* **Discovery**: Clients can list available tools through the `tools/list` endpoint
* **Invocation**: Tools are called using the `tools/call` endpoint, where servers perform the requested operation and return results
* **Flexibility**: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions
Like [resources](/docs/concepts/resources), tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.
## Tool definition structure
Each tool is defined with the following structure:
```typescript
{
name: string; // Unique identifier for the tool
description?: string; // Human-readable description
inputSchema: { // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters
type: "object",
properties: { ... } // Tool-specific parameters
},
annotations?: { // Optional hints about tool behavior
title?: string; // Human-readable title for the tool
readOnlyHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool does not modify its environment
destructiveHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool may perform destructive updates
idempotentHint?: boolean; // If true, repeated calls with same args have no additional effect
openWorldHint?: boolean; // If true, tool interacts with external entities
}
}
```
## Implementing tools
Here's an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
const server = new Server({
name: "example-server",
version: "1.0.0"
}, {
capabilities: {
tools: {}
}
});
// Define available tools
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
return {
tools: [{
name: "calculate_sum",
description: "Add two numbers together",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
a: { type: "number" },
b: { type: "number" }
},
required: ["a", "b"]
}
}]
};
});
// Handle tool execution
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
if (request.params.name === "calculate_sum") {
const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;
return {
content: [
{
type: "text",
text: String(a + b)
}
]
};
}
throw new Error("Tool not found");
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
app = Server("example-server")
@app.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
return [
types.Tool(
name="calculate_sum",
description="Add two numbers together",
inputSchema={
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"a": {"type": "number"},
"b": {"type": "number"}
},
"required": ["a", "b"]
}
)
]
@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(
name: str,
arguments: dict
) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:
if name == "calculate_sum":
a = arguments["a"]
b = arguments["b"]
result = a + b
return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=str(result))]
raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
## Example tool patterns
Here are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:
### System operations
Tools that interact with the local system:
```typescript
{
name: "execute_command",
description: "Run a shell command",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
command: { type: "string" },
args: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
}
}
}
```
### API integrations
Tools that wrap external APIs:
```typescript
{
name: "github_create_issue",
description: "Create a GitHub issue",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
title: { type: "string" },
body: { type: "string" },
labels: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
}
}
}
```
### Data processing
Tools that transform or analyze data:
```typescript
{
name: "analyze_csv",
description: "Analyze a CSV file",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
filepath: { type: "string" },
operations: {
type: "array",
items: {
enum: ["sum", "average", "count"]
}
}
}
}
}
```
## Best practices
When implementing tools:
1. Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions
2. Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters
3. Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them
4. Implement proper error handling and validation
5. Use progress reporting for long operations
6. Keep tool operations focused and atomic
7. Document expected return value structures
8. Implement proper timeouts
9. Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
10. Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring
## Security considerations
When exposing tools:
### Input validation
* Validate all parameters against the schema
* Sanitize file paths and system commands
* Validate URLs and external identifiers
* Check parameter sizes and ranges
* Prevent command injection
### Access control
* Implement authentication where needed
* Use appropriate authorization checks
* Audit tool usage
* Rate limit requests
* Monitor for abuse
### Error handling
* Don't expose internal errors to clients
* Log security-relevant errors
* Handle timeouts appropriately
* Clean up resources after errors
* Validate return values
## Tool discovery and updates
MCP supports dynamic tool discovery:
1. Clients can list available tools at any time
2. Servers can notify clients when tools change using `notifications/tools/list_changed`
3. Tools can be added or removed during runtime
4. Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)
## Error handling
Tool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:
1. Set `isError` to `true` in the result
2. Include error details in the `content` array
Here's an example of proper error handling for tools:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
try {
// Tool operation
const result = performOperation();
return {
content: [
{
type: "text",
text: `Operation successful: ${result}`
}
]
};
} catch (error) {
return {
isError: true,
content: [
{
type: "text",
text: `Error: ${error.message}`
}
]
};
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
try:
# Tool operation
result = perform_operation()
return types.CallToolResult(
content=[
types.TextContent(
type="text",
text=f"Operation successful: {result}"
)
]
)
except Exception as error:
return types.CallToolResult(
isError=True,
content=[
types.TextContent(
type="text",
text=f"Error: {str(error)}"
)
]
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
This approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.
## Tool annotations
Tool annotations provide additional metadata about a tool's behavior, helping clients understand how to present and manage tools. These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.
### Purpose of tool annotations
Tool annotations serve several key purposes:
1. Provide UX-specific information without affecting model context
2. Help clients categorize and present tools appropriately
3. Convey information about a tool's potential side effects
4. Assist in developing intuitive interfaces for tool approval
### Available tool annotations
The MCP specification defines the following annotations for tools:
| Annotation | Type | Default | Description |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title` | string | - | A human-readable title for the tool, useful for UI display |
| `readOnlyHint` | boolean | false | If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment |
| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true | If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false) |
| `idempotentHint` | boolean | false | If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false) |
| `openWorldHint` | boolean | true | If true, the tool may interact with an "open world" of external entities |
### Example usage
Here's how to define tools with annotations for different scenarios:
```typescript
// A read-only search tool
{
name: "web_search",
description: "Search the web for information",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
query: { type: "string" }
},
required: ["query"]
},
annotations: {
title: "Web Search",
readOnlyHint: true,
openWorldHint: true
}
}
// A destructive file deletion tool
{
name: "delete_file",
description: "Delete a file from the filesystem",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
path: { type: "string" }
},
required: ["path"]
},
annotations: {
title: "Delete File",
readOnlyHint: false,
destructiveHint: true,
idempotentHint: true,
openWorldHint: false
}
}
// A non-destructive database record creation tool
{
name: "create_record",
description: "Create a new record in the database",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
table: { type: "string" },
data: { type: "object" }
},
required: ["table", "data"]
},
annotations: {
title: "Create Database Record",
readOnlyHint: false,
destructiveHint: false,
idempotentHint: false,
openWorldHint: false
}
}
```
### Integrating annotations in server implementation
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
return {
tools: [{
name: "calculate_sum",
description: "Add two numbers together",
inputSchema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
a: { type: "number" },
b: { type: "number" }
},
required: ["a", "b"]
},
annotations: {
title: "Calculate Sum",
readOnlyHint: true,
openWorldHint: false
}
}]
};
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("example-server")
@mcp.tool(
annotations={
"title": "Calculate Sum",
"readOnlyHint": True,
"openWorldHint": False
}
)
async def calculate_sum(a: float, b: float) -> str:
"""Add two numbers together.
Args:
a: First number to add
b: Second number to add
"""
result = a + b
return str(result)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
### Best practices for tool annotations
1. **Be accurate about side effects**: Clearly indicate whether a tool modifies its environment and whether those modifications are destructive.
2. **Use descriptive titles**: Provide human-friendly titles that clearly describe the tool's purpose.
3. **Indicate idempotency properly**: Mark tools as idempotent only if repeated calls with the same arguments truly have no additional effect.
4. **Set appropriate open/closed world hints**: Indicate whether a tool interacts with a closed system (like a database) or an open system (like the web).
5. **Remember annotations are hints**: All properties in ToolAnnotations are hints and not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior. Clients should never make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.
## Testing tools
A comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:
* **Functional testing**: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately
* **Integration testing**: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies
* **Security testing**: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting
* **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
* **Error handling**: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources
# Sampling
> Let your servers request completions from LLMs
Sampling is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors while maintaining security and privacy.
<Info>
This feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.
</Info>
## How sampling works
The sampling flow follows these steps:
1. Server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client
2. Client reviews the request and can modify it
3. Client samples from an LLM
4. Client reviews the completion
5. Client returns the result to the server
This human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what the LLM sees and generates.
## Message format
Sampling requests use a standardized message format:
```typescript
{
messages: [
{
role: "user" | "assistant",
content: {
type: "text" | "image",
// For text:
text?: string,
// For images:
data?: string, // base64 encoded
mimeType?: string
}
}
],
modelPreferences?: {
hints?: [{
name?: string // Suggested model name/family
}],
costPriority?: number, // 0-1, importance of minimizing cost
speedPriority?: number, // 0-1, importance of low latency
intelligencePriority?: number // 0-1, importance of capabilities
},
systemPrompt?: string,
includeContext?: "none" | "thisServer" | "allServers",
temperature?: number,
maxTokens: number,
stopSequences?: string[],
metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}
```
## Request parameters
### Messages
The `messages` array contains the conversation history to send to the LLM. Each message has:
* `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
* `content`: The message content, which can be:
* Text content with a `text` field
* Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields
### Model preferences
The `modelPreferences` object allows servers to specify their model selection preferences:
* `hints`: Array of model name suggestions that clients can use to select an appropriate model:
* `name`: String that can match full or partial model names (e.g. "claude-3", "sonnet")
* Clients may map hints to equivalent models from different providers
* Multiple hints are evaluated in preference order
* Priority values (0-1 normalized):
* `costPriority`: Importance of minimizing costs
* `speedPriority`: Importance of low latency response
* `intelligencePriority`: Importance of advanced model capabilities
Clients make the final model selection based on these preferences and their available models.
### System prompt
An optional `systemPrompt` field allows servers to request a specific system prompt. The client may modify or ignore this.
### Context inclusion
The `includeContext` parameter specifies what MCP context to include:
* `"none"`: No additional context
* `"thisServer"`: Include context from the requesting server
* `"allServers"`: Include context from all connected MCP servers
The client controls what context is actually included.
### Sampling parameters
Fine-tune the LLM sampling with:
* `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
* `maxTokens`: Maximum tokens to generate
* `stopSequences`: Array of sequences that stop generation
* `metadata`: Additional provider-specific parameters
## Response format
The client returns a completion result:
```typescript
{
model: string, // Name of the model used
stopReason?: "endTurn" | "stopSequence" | "maxTokens" | string,
role: "user" | "assistant",
content: {
type: "text" | "image",
text?: string,
data?: string,
mimeType?: string
}
}
```
## Example request
Here's an example of requesting sampling from a client:
```json
{
"method": "sampling/createMessage",
"params": {
"messages": [
{
"role": "user",
"content": {
"type": "text",
"text": "What files are in the current directory?"
}
}
],
"systemPrompt": "You are a helpful file system assistant.",
"includeContext": "thisServer",
"maxTokens": 100
}
}
```
## Best practices
When implementing sampling:
1. Always provide clear, well-structured prompts
2. Handle both text and image content appropriately
3. Set reasonable token limits
4. Include relevant context through `includeContext`
5. Validate responses before using them
6. Handle errors gracefully
7. Consider rate limiting sampling requests
8. Document expected sampling behavior
9. Test with various model parameters
10. Monitor sampling costs
## Human in the loop controls
Sampling is designed with human oversight in mind:
### For prompts
* Clients should show users the proposed prompt
* Users should be able to modify or reject prompts
* System prompts can be filtered or modified
* Context inclusion is controlled by the client
### For completions
* Clients should show users the completion
* Users should be able to modify or reject completions
* Clients can filter or modify completions
* Users control which model is used
## Security considerations
When implementing sampling:
* Validate all message content
* Sanitize sensitive information
* Implement appropriate rate limits
* Monitor sampling usage
* Encrypt data in transit
* Handle user data privacy
* Audit sampling requests
* Control cost exposure
* Implement timeouts
* Handle model errors gracefully
## Common patterns
### Agentic workflows
Sampling enables agentic patterns like:
* Reading and analyzing resources
* Making decisions based on context
* Generating structured data
* Handling multi-step tasks
* Providing interactive assistance
### Context management
Best practices for context:
* Request minimal necessary context
* Structure context clearly
* Handle context size limits
* Update context as needed
* Clean up stale context
### Error handling
Robust error handling should:
* Catch sampling failures
* Handle timeout errors
* Manage rate limits
* Validate responses
* Provide fallback behaviors
* Log errors appropriately
## Limitations
Be aware of these limitations:
* Sampling depends on client capabilities
* Users control sampling behavior
* Context size has limits
* Rate limits may apply
* Costs should be considered
* Model availability varies
* Response times vary
* Not all content types supported
# Roots
> Understanding roots in MCP
Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant resources and their locations.
## What are Roots?
A root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI including HTTP URLs.
For example, roots could be:
```
file:///home/user/projects/myapp
https://api.example.com/v1
```
## Why Use Roots?
Roots serve several important purposes:
1. **Guidance**: They inform servers about relevant resources and locations
2. **Clarity**: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
3. **Organization**: Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously
## How Roots Work
When a client supports roots, it:
1. Declares the `roots` capability during connection
2. Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
3. Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)
While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:
1. Respect the provided roots
2. Use root URIs to locate and access resources
3. Prioritize operations within root boundaries
## Common Use Cases
Roots are commonly used to define:
* Project directories
* Repository locations
* API endpoints
* Configuration locations
* Resource boundaries
## Best Practices
When working with roots:
1. Only suggest necessary resources
2. Use clear, descriptive names for roots
3. Monitor root accessibility
4. Handle root changes gracefully
## Example
Here's how a typical MCP client might expose roots:
```json
{
"roots": [
{
"uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
"name": "Frontend Repository"
},
{
"uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
"name": "API Endpoint"
}
]
}
```
This configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.
# Transports
> Learn about MCP's communication mechanisms
Transports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provide the foundation for communication between clients and servers. A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.
## Message Format
MCP uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 as its wire format. The transport layer is responsible for converting MCP protocol messages into JSON-RPC format for transmission and converting received JSON-RPC messages back into MCP protocol messages.
There are three types of JSON-RPC messages used:
### Requests
```typescript
{
jsonrpc: "2.0",
id: number | string,
method: string,
params?: object
}
```
### Responses
```typescript
{
jsonrpc: "2.0",
id: number | string,
result?: object,
error?: {
code: number,
message: string,
data?: unknown
}
}
```
### Notifications
```typescript
{
jsonrpc: "2.0",
method: string,
params?: object
}
```
## Built-in Transport Types
MCP includes two standard transport implementations:
### Standard Input/Output (stdio)
The stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools.
Use stdio when:
* Building command-line tools
* Implementing local integrations
* Needing simple process communication
* Working with shell scripts
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript (Server)">
```typescript
const server = new Server({
name: "example-server",

```
</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript (Client)">

name: "example-client",
version: "1.0.0"
}, {
capabilities: {}
});

args: ["--option", "value"]
});
await client.connect(transport);
```

args=["--option", "value"]
)
async with stdio_client(params) as streams:
async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:
await session.initialize()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
<Warning>
The SSE Transport has been [**replaced**](http://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/changelog#major-changes) with a more
flexible [Streamable HTTP](http://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports) transport. Refer to the [Specification](http://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports)
and latest SDKs for the most recent information.
</Warning>
SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication.
Use SSE when:
* Only server-to-client streaming is needed
* Working with restricted networks
* Implementing simple updates
#### Security Warning: DNS Rebinding Attacks
SSE transports can be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks if not properly secured. To prevent this:
1. **Always validate Origin headers** on incoming SSE connections to ensure they come from expected sources
2. **Avoid binding servers to all network interfaces** (0.0.0.0) when running locally - bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead
3. **Implement proper authentication** for all SSE connections
Without these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.

## Custom Transports
MCP makes it easy to implement custom transports for specific needs. Any transport implementation just needs to conform to the Transport interface:
You can implement custom transports for:
* Custom network protocols
* Specialized communication channels
* Integration with existing systems
* Performance optimization
<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
interface Transport {
// Start processing messages
start(): Promise<void>;
// Send a JSON-RPC message
send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void>;
// Close the connection
close(): Promise<void>;
// Callbacks
onclose?: () => void;
onerror?: (error: Error) => void;
onmessage?: (message: JSONRPCMessage) => void;
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend
implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.

## Error Handling
Transport implementations should handle various error scenarios:
1. Connection errors
2. Message parsing errors
3. Protocol errors
4. Network timeouts
5. Resource cleanup
Example error handling:

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
class ExampleTransport implements Transport {
async start() {
try {
// Connection logic
} catch (error) {
this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to connect: ${error}`));
throw error;
}
}
async send(message: JSONRPCMessage) {
try {
// Sending logic
} catch (error) {
this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to send message: ${error}`));
throw error;
}
}
}
```

Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend
implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.
```python
@contextmanager
async def example_transport(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send):
try:
# Create streams for bidirectional communication
read_stream_writer, read_stream = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)
write_stream, write_stream_reader = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)
async def message_handler():
try:
async with read_stream_writer:
# Message handling logic
pass
except Exception as exc:
logger.error(f"Failed to handle message: {exc}")
raise exc
async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
tg.start_soon(message_handler)
try:
# Yield streams for communication
yield read_stream, write_stream
except Exception as exc:
logger.error(f"Transport error: {exc}")
raise exc
finally:
tg.cancel_scope.cancel()
await write_stream.aclose()
await read_stream.aclose()
except Exception as exc:
logger.error(f"Failed to initialize transport: {exc}")
raise exc
```

## Best Practices
When implementing or using MCP transport:
1. Handle connection lifecycle properly
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Clean up resources on connection close
4. Use appropriate timeouts
5. Validate messages before sending
6. Log transport events for debugging
7. Implement reconnection logic when appropriate
8. Handle backpressure in message queues
9. Monitor connection health
10. Implement proper security measures
## Security Considerations
When implementing transport:
### Authentication and Authorization
* Implement proper authentication mechanisms
* Validate client credentials
* Use secure token handling
* Implement authorization checks
### Data Security
* Use TLS for network transport
* Encrypt sensitive data
* Validate message integrity
* Implement message size limits
* Sanitize input data
### Network Security
* Implement rate limiting
* Use appropriate timeouts
* Handle denial of service scenarios
* Monitor for unusual patterns
* Implement proper firewall rules
* For SSE transports, validate Origin headers to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
* For local SSE servers, bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
## Debugging Transport
Tips for debugging transport issues:
1. Enable debug logging
2. Monitor message flow
3. Check connection states
4. Validate message formats
5. Test error scenarios
6. Use network analysis tools
7. Implement health checks
8. Monitor resource usage
9. Test edge cases
10. Use proper error tracking
