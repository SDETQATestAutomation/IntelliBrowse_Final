   - Redistribute pending executions to healthy nodes
   - Preserve execution context and partial results

2. **Recovery Execution** (30-120 seconds):
   - Attempt node health restoration procedures
   - Migrate active executions to backup nodes
   - Synchronize state with distributed checkpoint system

3. **Completion** (120+ seconds):
   - Resume executions from last valid checkpoint
   - Update execution graphs with recovery metadata
   - Generate recovery report and performance impact analysis

**Success Criteria**: 95% of partial executions resume within 2 minutes

#### Scenario: Database Connection Failures
