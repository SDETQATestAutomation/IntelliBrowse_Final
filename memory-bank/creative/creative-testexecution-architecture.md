## ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE COMPONENT 1: ASYNC EXECUTION RUNNER DESIGN

### Component Requirements
Design a safe, cancelable async runner that can orchestrate test case and suite executions with guaranteed state transitions, concurrency control, and fault tolerance.

### Option 1: State Machine-Based Execution Runner
**Description**: Implement execution runner using explicit state machine with atomic transitions

**Architecture**:
```python
class ExecutionStateMachine:
    VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
        ExecutionStatus.PENDING: [ExecutionStatus.RUNNING, ExecutionStatus.CANCELLED],
        ExecutionStatus.RUNNING: [ExecutionStatus.PASSED, ExecutionStatus.FAILED, ExecutionStatus.CANCELLED, ExecutionStatus.TIMEOUT],
        ExecutionStatus.PASSED: [],
        ExecutionStatus.FAILED: [ExecutionStatus.RETRYING],
        ExecutionStatus.RETRYING: [ExecutionStatus.RUNNING, ExecutionStatus.ABORTED],
        ExecutionStatus.CANCELLED: [],
        ExecutionStatus.TIMEOUT: [ExecutionStatus.RETRYING],
        ExecutionStatus.ABORTED: []
    }
    
    async def transition_state(self, execution_id: str, new_state: ExecutionStatus) -> bool:
        # Atomic state transition with validation
        pass
```

**Pros**:

```python
class ExecutionEventBus:
    async def emit(self, event: ExecutionEvent) -> None:
        # Async event emission with fanout to subscribers
        pass

class ExecutionRunner:
    async def execute(self, test_case_id: str) -> AsyncIterator[ExecutionEvent]:
        # Emit events as execution progresses
        yield ExecutionStartedEvent(...)
        yield StepExecutedEvent(...)
        yield ExecutionCompletedEvent(...)
```

        self.state_machine = ExecutionStateMachine()
        self.event_bus = ExecutionEventBus()
    
    async def execute_with_tracking(self, test_case_id: str) -> ExecutionResult:
        # State machine for reliability + events for observability
        await self.state_machine.transition_state(execution_id, ExecutionStatus.RUNNING)
        await self.event_bus.emit(ExecutionStartedEvent(...))
        # Continue execution...
```

    test_case_id: Optional[str]
    test_suite_id: Optional[str]
    execution_type: ExecutionType
    overall_status: ExecutionStatus
    total_duration_ms: int
    
    # Smart partitioning based on step count
    use_embedded_steps: bool = True  # True if step_count <= EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD
    embedded_step_traces: Optional[List[ExecutionStepTrace]] = None
    
    # Metadata for large executions
    step_count: int = 0
    partition_count: int = 0
    
    @classmethod
    async def create_trace(cls, execution_data: ExecutionData) -> "SmartExecutionTrace":
        if execution_data.estimated_step_count <= EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD:
            return cls.create_embedded_trace(execution_data)
