## System Summary

### System Description
The Orchestration Engine is a comprehensive job scheduling and execution management system designed for IntelliBrowse's test automation platform. It implements a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine with sophisticated retry mechanisms, recovery procedures, and state management capabilities. The system orchestrates complex test execution workflows with parallel processing, dependency management, and robust error handling.

### System Context
The Orchestration Engine serves as the central coordination point for all test execution activities within IntelliBrowse. It integrates with existing modules (Test Execution, Test Cases, Test Suites) to provide intelligent job scheduling, execution monitoring, and failure recovery. The system bridges user-initiated test runs with the underlying execution infrastructure, providing transparency and control over complex test workflows.

### Key Components
