## Implementation Overview
**Date**: 2025-01-06 23:45:00 UTC  
**Phase**: IMPLEMENT - Phase 2: DAG Execution Engine & Node Runner  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Directory**: `src/backend/orchestration/engine/`  
**Implementation Type**: Level 4 Complex System - Phase 2 Core Engine Implementation  

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the Orchestration & Recovery Engine with comprehensive DAG execution capabilities, individual node execution services, and persistent state tracking. The implementation provides asynchronous task resolution, stage dependency evaluation, state transitions, and controlled execution flow recovery.

## Architecture & Design Rationale

### DAG Execution Engine Design
The DAGExecutionEngine follows an event-driven, worker-pool architecture that:
- Maintains in-memory execution graphs for fast dependency resolution
- Uses asyncio.Queue for ready node scheduling with worker tasks
- Implements proper cycle detection using depth-first search algorithms
- Provides comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- Supports parallel execution with configurable semaphore limiting

### Node Runner Service Design
The NodeRunnerService implements a strategy pattern for node execution:
- Supports multiple execution strategies (direct, queued, parallel, sequential, conditional)
- Provides timeout-aware execution using anyio for robust fallback recovery
- Implements comprehensive context injection for test item/case/suite references
- Includes node type handlers for all supported execution types
- Emits structured state updates for monitoring and debugging

### Execution State Tracker Design
The ExecutionStateTracker manages persistent state with:
- MongoDB-backed state persistence with async operations
- In-memory caching for fast state access and updates
- State transition validation with comprehensive error reporting
- Stall detection algorithms for identifying blocked execution
- Cleanup mechanisms for completed execution graph retention
